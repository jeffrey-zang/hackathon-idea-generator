# Hackathon Idea Generator
[Website](https://helpineedideas.vercel.app/) that generates a hackathon or programming project when given a theme.

### How it works
1. React, NextJS, and HTML/CSS render the UI
2. User inputs the theme
3. Gets fed into OpenAI's API, with `text-curie-001` model
4. Text size is limited to 400 tokens or ~1600 characters
5. Idea is returned and rendered onto frontend with use of React Hooks

### Stuff I used
- React/NextJS
- OpenAI API
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- Vercel for deployment
- Logo: <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/lamp" title="lamp icons">Lamp icons created by AB Design - Flaticon</a>
